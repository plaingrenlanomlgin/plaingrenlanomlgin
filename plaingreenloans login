Advocates of payday loans frequently point to the help that readily available, small-dollar credit provides to borrowers when financial difficulties arise. And although borrowers agree that credit can be beneficial, they say cost is a major factor in determining whether loans are helpful. Banks would be likely to offer loans of $400 for a fee of about $60 if the 5 percent payment option is included in the CFPBâ€™s final rule, while payday lenders would charge fees of around $350 for the same $400 loan issued under the proposed longer-term ATR provision, meaning borrowers view the potential bank loans as far more helpful than payday installment loans. The bank loan with a $60 fee would have an APR of 88 percent, compared with an APR of 473 percent for the payday loan.
